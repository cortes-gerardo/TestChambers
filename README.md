TestChambers
============
**TDD**, **design patterns** and Java best practices using Google libraries.

Every chamber is thinking for show a moderate complex example for every day problems, since **text book examples are made
too simple and don't have considerations like Error Handling, Dependency Injection or N-tier Architecture** that
has to be the norm.

Plus, the utility classes are general solutions for any software, like the `Id.java` ([link](./src/main/java/util/id/Id.java)) that you can use, copy, modify
for your project.
